      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Social Hub</strong>!  
        This is a space where people with different hobbies and backgrounds can connect, share, and grow together.  
        It started with Alice, Bob, and Charlie meeting around their passions—and now, it’s a community for everyone.
